# CHIP8

:joystick: A CHIP8 interpreter.

## ROMs
About the ROMs, I just got a pack of games for Chip8 [here](https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html)

## Bugs
Some games just doesn't work and I still need to figure out the problem, it is just a simple CHIP8 interpreter,
not a Super Chip8 interpreter, therefore some opcodes weren't implemented, that causes bugs on some games. 

Snake game works fine and it is enough for me :smile:.
