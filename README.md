# CHIP8
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

:joystick: A CHIP8 interpreter.

By the way, that's the fifth time that I am trying to build a CHIP8 interpreter. For some reason, I just don't
want to give up.

## Installation
You can clone the repository and run `go build` and `go run .`. It will install all dependencies first and
run the program in the second comand.

## ROMs
About the ROMs, I just got a pack of games for Chip8 [here](https://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8/chip-8-games-pack.html)
